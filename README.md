# Employee Attrition & Survival Analysis ‚≠ê

This project focuses on understanding employee attrition patterns & survival time within an organization using:
- **Excel Dashboard** ‚Äì for interactive visual insights into attrition trends across demographics, tenure, education, and city.
- **R Survival Analysis** ‚Äì for statistical analysis of employee survival time, measuring how long employees tend to stay in the organization and what factors influence their departure.

Together, these methods provide a comprehensive view of workforce dynamics, combining business intelligence visualization with statistical modeling.

## Excel Dashboard

### Key insights include:
- Cross-demographic Insights ‚Äì attrition rates among Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, and PhD holders across age groups.
- Experience vs Attrition ‚Äì attrition peaks around three years of experience.
- Gender-wise Attrition ‚Äì female employees show higher attrition rates than males.
- City-wise Attrition ‚Äì Pune shows the highest attrition at 50%.
- Cohort Analysis ‚Äì employees who joined in 2018 had the highest attrition.
- Impact of Benching ‚Äì Payment Tier 2 employees on the bench are most prone to leaving.
### At the top of the dashboard, summary KPIs are provided:
- Total Attrition % (34.39%)
- Total Employees Who Stayed (3053)

- Displays the probability of employees staying over time (measured in years of experience).
- Shows a steady decline in retention probability, with sharp drops after 2‚Äì4 years.

### Employee Survival Curve by Education

- Compares survival probabilities across employees with Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, and PhD degrees.
- Master‚Äôs graduates show faster decline in retention compared to Bachelor‚Äôs and PhD holders.

### Employee Survival Curve by Payment Tier

- Compares employees across Payment Tiers 1, 2, and 3.
- Tier 2 employees show the steepest decline in retention, validating the dashboard finding that they are most prone to leaving.

## Instructions
- The Excel workbook contains two sheets:
  - Data Sheet ‚Äì raw employee records used for analysis.
  -  Dashboard Sheet ‚Äì visualizations and interactive pivot-based analysis.
- The R Script generates the survival analysis visualizations and can be reused with similar HR datasets to model attrition patterns.
